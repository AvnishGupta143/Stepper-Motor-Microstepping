## THIS IS ROS PACKAGE FOR CONTROLLING STEPPER MOTOR USING ARDUINO IN ROS.
## THE SCRIPT FORLDER HAS PYTHON CODE USING PYSERIAL LIBRARY TO PERFORM THE UART COMMUNICATION WITH ARDUINO. IT ASKS FOR A INPUT SPEED IN MM/s and STEPPPING MODE. THE STEPPING MODE DEFINES THE DISTANCE IN SINGLE STEP THE MOTOR WOULD TURN OR MOVE A LINEAR ACTUATOR IF CONNECTED. IT CAN BE CHANGED FOR DIFFERENT MOTOR BY MAKING CHANGES IN ARDUINO CODE.
